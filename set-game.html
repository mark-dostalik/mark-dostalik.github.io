    <h2>SET Game</h2>

    <p>
        Inspired by the <a href="https://henrikwarne.com/2011/09/30/set-probabilities-revisited/" target="_blank">blog
        post</a> of Henrik Warne, I set out to implement yet another Monte Carlo simulation of the classic card game <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(card_game)" target="_blank">SET&#174;</a>, this time in Python. I ran
        <b>1 billion</b> game simulations to confirm Warne's findings. Full Python solution is available on my <a
        href="https://github.com/mark-dostalik/set-game" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>Rules</h3>
    <p>
        The game of SET is played with a deck of 81 cards. Each card is unique with respect to four card
        features: <b>number</b> of shapes (one, two, three), <b>shape</b> (diamond, squiggle, oval),
        <b>shading</b> (solid, striped, open), and <b>color</b> (red, green, purple). A combination of three
        cards in which each of the four features have either all the same value or have all different values
        is called a SET.
    </p>

    <p>
        The game starts with 12 cards being laid out face up from the shuffled deck. Players then
        simultaneously look for SETs in the dealt cards. When a SET is found, the three cards are removed
        and replaced by three more from the deck. If at any point there is no SET among the dealt cards,
        three more cards are added. The game ends when there are no more SETs to be found in the dealt
        cards.
    </p>

    <p>
        For instance, this is what the initial 12-card layout may look like:
    <div class="grid-container-12">
        <div class="grid-item">
            <img src="content/set-game/cards/1HrD.svg" alt="1HrD">
        </div>
        <div class="grid-item">
            <img src="content/set-game/cards/3HpP.svg" alt="1OgP">
        </div>
        <div class="grid-item">
            <img src="content/set-game/cards/1HgP.svg" alt="1HgP">
        </div>
        <div class="grid-item">
            <img src="content/set-game/cards/2OgD.svg" alt="2OgD">
        </div>
        <div class="grid-item">
            <img src="content/set-game/cards/2HgP.svg" alt="2OpD">
        </div>
        <div class="grid-item">
            <img src="content/set-game/cards/2OpP.svg" alt="2OpP">
        </div>
        <div class="grid-item">
            <img src="content/set-game/cards/2OrS.svg" alt="20rS">
        </div>
        <div class="grid-item">
            <img src="content/set-game/cards/3SrS.svg" alt="3SrS">
        </div>
        <div class="grid-item">
            <img src="content/set-game/cards/2SrD.svg" alt="2SrD">
        </div>
        <div class="grid-item">
            <img src="content/set-game/cards/3OgD.svg" alt="3OgD">
        </div>
        <div class="grid-item">
            <img src="content/set-game/cards/3SgS.svg" alt="3SgS">
        </div>
        <div class="grid-item">
            <img src="content/set-game/cards/2SpD.svg" alt="2SpD">
        </div>
    </div>
    There are multiple sets in this layout, one of them being:
    <div class="grid-container-3">
        <div class="grid-item">
            <img src="content/set-game/cards/2OrS.svg" alt="20rS">
        </div>
        <div class="grid-item">
            <img src="content/set-game/cards/2SpD.svg" alt="2SpD">
        </div>
        <div class="grid-item">
            <img src="content/set-game/cards/2HgP.svg" alt="2HgP">
        </div>
    </div>
    These cards indeed form a SET since all three cards have the same <b>number</b> of symbols, different
    <b>colors</b>, different <b>shapes</b>, and different <b>shadings</b>.
    </p>

    <p>
        On the other hand, the following triplet of cards <i>does not</i> form a SET since the <b>shapes</b>
        of the symbols are neither all the same nor different:
    <div class="grid-container-3">
        <div class="grid-item">
            <img src="content/set-game/cards/1HrD.svg" alt="1HgP">
        </div>
        <div class="grid-item">
            <img src="content/set-game/cards/2HgP.svg" alt="2HgP">
        </div>
        <div class="grid-item">
            <img src="content/set-game/cards/3HpP.svg" alt="1OgP">
        </div>
    </div>
    </p>

    <h3>Monte Carlo simulation</h3>

    <p>
        While playing the game of SET many questions arise that are inherently mathematical. To state the most famous
        one – what is the largest <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cap_set" target="_blank">cap SET</a> possible
        (cap SET is a layout of cards in which no SET can be found)? The answer to this question is 20 as was
        analytically proved in [<a href="#ref1">1</a>] (somewhat surprisingly, even before the game came to existence).
    </p>

    <p>
        The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(card_game)" target="_blank">wiki page</a> of the game SET
        contains many facts on the combinatorial properties of the game but the most comprehensive mathematical
        exploration of the game can be found in [<a href="#ref2">2</a>]. Yet, some questions cannot be answered
        analytically and require computer simulations. My goal was to answer the following questions:
    </p>
    <p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            What is the probability that there is no SET in the dealt cards during the game?
        </li>
        <li>
            What is the mean and variance of the number of SETs in the dealt cards during the game?
        </li>
        <li>
            What is the probability that no cards are left uncollected at the end of the game?
        </li>
        <li>
            What is the probability that there are no more than 12 cards dealt during the game?
        </li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
        I use the word <em>probability</em> in a loose sense here and onwards. Of course, in Monte Carlo simulations we
        are only sampling from the true probability distributions and relying on the law of large numbers. The term
        "probability" is hence used in this approximative sense in the rest of this post.
    </p>

    <p>
        In total, I ran <b>1 billion</b> game simulations. The code is parallelized and ran for about 13 hours on my
        10-core M1 chip.
    </p>

    <h4>SET selection method</h4>

    <p>
        To emulate the real game as much as possible I decided to implement the following approach for choosing
        SETs from dealt cards. Each SET is assigned a "similarity" score which is the number of features that
        have the three cards forming the SET in common plus one (to ensure positivity).
    </p>

    <p>
        For instance, the cards forming the SET from the previous section only share the same number of
        shapes and thus, its "similarity" score would be 1 + 1 = 2. The "similarity" scores range from 1
        (all features are different) to 4 (only one feature is different). Note that it is not possible for
        all four features to be the same since then the three cards would be identical (and each card in the
        deck is unique).
    </p>

    <p>
        The "similarity" scores are then used as weights in the random selection of a SET from the dealt cards. This
        method is based on the (speculative) assumption that human players are more likely to spot SETs having more
        features in common.
    </p>

    <p>
        Of course, in real world, human mistakes take place – players are unable to find a SET in dealt cards
        when there is one, players incorrectly collect three cards that do not form a SET, etc. My simulation falls
        short of taking into account these errors and assumes players that play "perfectly".
    </p>

    <h4>Aggregate statistics</h4>

    <p>
        The probability of no SET occurring among the dealt cards as game progresses is shown below. The plot is
        <b>interactive</b> – I encourage you to isolate individual traces by double-clicking the corresponding legend
        item. Total <b>number of occurrences</b> out of the 1 billion game simulations for each point in the graph is
        also available on hover.
    </p>

    <p>
        The probability of a cap SET in the initial 12-card layout is around 3.2% but rises up to ~7% near the end of
        the game. For 15-card layouts, the probabilities change non-monotonically but are bounded between 1% and 1.2%.
        For 18-card layouts, the probabilities become almost negligible and for 21-card layouts probability of not
        finding a SET is zero in all game states, as expected. Note that with respect to the total 1 billion game
        simulations, there are few occurrences of the cases where 18, let alone 21, cards were dealt.
    </p>


    <iframe src="content/set-game/plots/prob_no_set.html" width="100%" height="550px" frameborder="0"></iframe>

    <p>
        Similarly, average number of SETs that can be found among the dealt cards for all possible game states is shown
        in the interactive plot below. In addition to the mean, <b>variance</b> of the number of SETs in the dealt cards
        is available on hover.
    </p>

    <p>
        Interestingly, while average number of SETs in 12-card layouts diminishes as game progresses, average numbers of
        SETs in 15-card and 18-card layouts exhibit non-monotonic trend, peaking shortly after the game starts. For each
        of the 21-card layouts, we only have tens of observations so the average numbers of SETs found in these layouts
        is hardly representative.
    </p>

    <iframe src="content/set-game/plots/num_sets_mean.html" width="100%" height="550px" frameborder="0"></iframe>

    <p>
        Note that the states where fewer than 12 cards are dealt are deliberately left out of the plots since these
        cases occur at the end of the game only (when there are no more cards in the deck). Statistics for
        fewer-than-12-cards-dealt situations are recorded in the table below.
    </p>

    <table>
        <caption>end-of-game statistics</caption>
        <thead>
        <tr>
            <th># dealt cards</th>
            <th>probability of no SET</th>
            <th>mean of # SETs</th>
            <th>variance of # SETs</th>
            <th># occurrences</th>
        </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>3</td>
            <td>0</td>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>0</td>
            <td>12,200,055</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>6</td>
            <td>0.975</td>
            <td>0.051</td>
            <td>0.099</td>
            <td>480,221,638</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>9</td>
            <td>0.481</td>
            <td>0.668</td>
            <td>0.581</td>
            <td>925,506,439</td>
        </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>
        Another statistic of interest is the probability of playing a "perfect" game, i.e. of finishing the game with 27
        SETs collected by players. This is equivalent to the situation where no cards remain on the table at the end of
        the game.
    </p>
    <p>
        More generally, we can ask what the probability of \( 3k \) cards remaining on the table at the end of the game
        is. Note that since the maximum cap set size is 20, there can be at most 18 cards left at the end of the game
        and hence \( 0 \le k \le 6 \). Moreover, one can easily prove that if there are only three cards dealt, these
        cards <em>must</em> form a SET (this is also supported by the end-of-game statistics table above). Hence, it is
        not possible for a game of SET to end with 3 cards remaining on the table.
    </p>

    <p>
        Finally, if \( n \) is the number of cards remaining on table at the end of the game then there have been \( 27
        - n \) SETs collected in total. Using this fact we can relate the probability of \( n \) cards remaining at the
        end of the game with the probability of having collected \( 27 - n \) SETs in total which explains the double
        x-axis in the plot below. We can see that only about 1% of the games are "perfect" while more than 91% of the
        games end with 6 or 9 cards left on the table.
    </p>

    <iframe src="content/set-game/plots/num_found_sets.html" width="100%" height="500px" frameborder="0"></iframe>

    <p>
        How often is it necessary to deal more than 12 cards throughout the game? It turns out that around 31% of the
        games never need to deal 15 cards as the plot below captures. Moreover, more than 98% of the games never need to
        deal 18 cards. (My wife and I dealt 18 cards several times during our first game of SET so this must have been
        due to our poor skills at finding SETs at that time.)
    </p>

    <h4>Conclusion</h4>
    <p>
        My aggregate simulation statistics very closely match the results stated in Henrik Warne's blog post (as well as
        the computer simulation results found in [<a href="#ref2">2</a>]). Having been able to simulate more games, my
        results include additional statistics for the game states that have more than 15 cards dealt. In addition,
        variances of the number of SETs in dealt cards are included.
