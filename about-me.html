            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                My academic background is in physics and mathematical modeling. During my PhD studies, I focused on
                thermomechanics of
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npZzlgKjs0I" target="_blank">complex fluids</a>, while during
                my postdoctoral research, I was developing a mathematical model for cell membrane growth in bacterial
                division. I have a strong foundation in mathematics, particularly in partial differential equations,
                as well as probability and statistics, linear algebra, and machine learning.
            </p>
            <p>
                In between my MSc and PhD studies, I gained valuable industry experience at
                <a href="https://spaceknow.com/" target="_blank">SpaceKnow</a>, where I worked as a machine learning
                engineer in geospatial analysis. During this time, I was introduced to machine learning and developed
                expertise in image processing and computer vision. My role also involved general software development
                in Python.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the summer of 2022, I joined the international pharmaceutical company
                <a href="https://www.msd.cz/cs/" target="_blank">MSD</a> as a data scientist. My primary focus here is
                on developing software infrastructure for processing and analyzing image data obtained through spatial
                transcriptomics technologies. This innovative profiling method enables the mapping of gene expressions
                to spatial locations within histological tissue sections, making it particularly valuable for
                studies related to Alzheimer's disease.
